# InteractiveVideoEditorPRO
##Create your very own "Bandersnatch" Game

* Create a video with all scenes concatenated (intro, good decision, bad decision,bad decision2, etc...)
* Use the Editor to create a .html that manages your Video-Game.
* When using the Editor create a starting point from zero to ... and then link to another scene (decision part)
* Keep making decisions, you may even link to a scene before the actual scene.
* Keep in mind that you're dealing with video clips, if you don't define the clip (start-end), this part won't play.

  Enjoy!
